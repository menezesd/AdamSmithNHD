    <h3 id="feudalism">Feudalism</h3>

    <p>Feudalism was the economic system used between A.D. 400 and
    A.D. 1400. Under feudalism, land was owned by nobles who
    provided protection as well as use of land for serfs. Serfs
    worked for a living and gave almost all the proceeds of the
    land to the nobles. After the Black Death between 1346 and
    1351, feudalism was no longer self-sustaining.</p>

    <h3 id="mercantilism">Mercantilism</h3>

    <p>Previously, trade with Asia was dominated by the Italians.
    Because the Black Death first appeared in Italy, Europeans
    wanted a new land route to Asia. However, because the Ottoman
    Empire restricted trade by land, it was necessary to find a sea
    route:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The commercial revolution may be said arbitrarily to have
      begun in 1488 when the Bartholomew Diaz rounded Cape Horn and
      thus pioneered a non-Mediterranean route to trade that soon
      involved direct European contacts in the whole arc from Japan
      to the Persian Gulf. (Rostow 107)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>After Bartholomew Diaz's voyage, exploration continued.
    Mercantilism formed the basis of colonization in the Americas.
    Under mercantilism, nations sought keep imports less than
    exports and to accumulate pecuniary wealth in the form of
    precious metals. The British imposed the Navigation Acts of
    1651 on the American colonies in an attempt to give Britain a
    monopoly on imports and exports to the American colonies. The
    government strictly regulated production, and set limits on
    wages and the number of apprentices one could take:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In 1666, a French law stated that "If a cloth weaver
      intends to process a piece according to his own invention, he
      must not set in on the loom, but hes should obtain permission
      from the judges of the town to employ the number and length
      of threads he desires, after the question has been considered
      by 4 of the oldest merchants and 4 of the oldest weavers of
      the guild." (Heilbroner 30)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In contrast to Smith's idea of the "invisible hand,"
    followers of the mercantilist system held a negative view
    toward competition:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Instead of risk and change, the model was safety first.
      Advertising was forbidden, and the idea that one master
      guildsman might produce a better produce than his colleagues
      was regarded as treasonable. (Heilbroner 28)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mercantilism was the dominant economic system between 1400 and
    1800. Smith's <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> and the beginning of
    the Industrial revolution led to mercantilism's downfall.  In
    the <cite> Wealth of Nations</cite>, Smith argued against the
    mercantilist idea of artificially maintaining a trade surplus:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to
      attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than
      to buy.  The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but
      buys them of the shoemaker.  The shoemaker does not attempt to
      make his own clothes but employs a tailor.&hellip;</p>

      <p>What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can
      scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.  If a foreign
      country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves
      can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce
      of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some
      advantage. (Smith 194)</p>
    </blockquote>

      <p style="caption">Smith used grapes to show the ridiculousness
      of the restriction of imports to encourage domestic industry
      (Photograph from Wikimedia Commons).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Smith argued that the notion of a "protective tariff" or other
    restriction on importation to encourage domestic industry is
    ridiculous and detrimental to the interests of the populace:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>By means of glasses, hotbeds, and hot walls, very good grapes
      can be raised in Scotland, and very good wine too can be made of
      them at about thirty times the expense for which at least
      equally good can be brought from foreign countries.  Would it be
      a reasonable law to prohibit the importation of all foreign
      wines merely to encourage the making of claret and burgundy in
      Scotland? (Smith 195)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="physiocrats">The Physiocrats</h3>

    <p>The Physiocrats were a group of economists who, like Adam
    Smith, believed in individualism and
    <a href="capitalism.html#whatisit"><em lang="fr" xml:lang=
    "fr">laissez-faire</em></a>. However, they believed that the
    wealth of nations was derived only from agriculture and regarded
    the work of artisans, manufactures, and merchants as "sterile."
    Smith felt that reduction in the number of artisans and
    manufactures would diminish the market for agricultural produce
    and thereby discourage agriculture:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Every system which endeavors, either by extraordinary
      encouragements to draw towards a particular species of
      industry a greater share of the capital of the society than
      what would naturally go to it, or, by extraordinary
      restraints, force from a particular species of industry some
      share of the capital which would otherwise be employed in in,
      is in reality subversive of the great purpose which it means
      to promote. It retards, instead of accelerating, the progress
      of society and greatness; and diminishes, instead of
      increasing, the real value of the annual produce of its land
      and labour. (Smith 300)</p>
    </blockquote>
