    <h3 id="birth">Early Life</h3>

    <p>Adam Smith was born in Kirkadly, Scotland on June 5, 1723.
    His father, also named Adam Smith, had died five months before
    Smith's birth. In 1726, Smith was kidnapped by gypsies and then
    rescued by his uncle:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's
      house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was
      stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not
      be found. But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a
      gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that
      was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in
      the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in
      Leslie wood. As soon as she saw them she threw her burden
      down and escaped, and the child was brought back to his
      mother. [Smith] would have made, I fear, a poor gypsy. (Rae
      5)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="education">Education</h3>

    <p>At 14, Smith matriculated at the University at Glasgow.
    Although this seems young by today's standards, this was
    actually slightly above the average age of entrants at the
    time. After studying there for three years, he went to the
    Baliol College in Oxford on a scholarship. Smith was disgusted
    with Oxford, and criticized it in the <cite>Wealth of
    Nations</cite>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In the university of Oxford, the greater part of the
      public professors have, for these many years given up
      altogether even the pretence of teaching. (Smith 332)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>

    <p>In 1746, Smith left Oxford before his scholarship expired.
    Beginning in 1748, Smith lectured at Edinburgh on economics and
    moral philosophy. From 1751 to 1763, he taught logic and moral
    philosophy at the University of Glasgow. In 1759, he published
    some of his Glasgow lectures in the <cite>Theory of Moral
    Sentiments</cite>. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of
    Laws in 1762.</p>

    <h3 id="travels">Travels</h3>

    <p id="travels">In 1764, Smith became tutor to the Duke of
    Buccleuch. During this time he toured Europe and met with many
    intellectual leaders, including Benjamin Franklin and
    Voltaire.</p>

    <h3 id="writings">Later Life</h3>

    <p>In 1766, he retired to Kirkadly and began work on <cite>The
    Wealth of Nations</cite>, which was published in 1776. In 1778,
    Smith was appointed commissioner of customs in Scotland. Smith
    died on July 17, 1790 and buried in the Canongate Kirkyard.</p>
