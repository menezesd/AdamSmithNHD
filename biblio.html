    Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc, 1952.</p>

    <p>Adam Smith's work, <cite>An Inquiry into the Nature and
    Causes of the Wealth of Nations</cite>, is an account of the
    state of economics at the beginning of the Industrial
    Revolution. It also advocates a free-market economy as more
    productive and beneficial to society. Some useful quotations
    from this source were the example of the process of pin making
    in the division of labor, and the example in favor of freedom
    of trade of how grapes might be grown in Scotland at thirty
    times the cost but it would be ridiculous to forbid their
    importation. I used information from this site in the section
    about how <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</em>
    capitalism works.</p>

    <p>This collection of images provided pictures of Adam Smith
    for use on my website. From this source, I used five images.
    These images were engravings of Adam Smith as well as a
    photograph of a statue of him and a photograph of his
    gravestone. I used these photographs on my website in order to
    illustrate what Adam Smith looked like in the biography as well
    as to provide decoration for the various sections.</p>

    &lt;http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3113/smith/dugald&gt;.</p>

    <p>This source is an eighteenth-century biography of Adam
    Smith. It describes his life, as well as the ideas that went
    into his work on political economy, <cite>An Inquiry into the
    Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</cite>. Useful
    information from this source included the account of his
    kidnapping by gypsies, as well as descriptions of how Smith
    received some of his ideas about free trade in France.
    Information from this source was used on my website in the
    section that is the biography of Adam Smith.</p>

    <p class="biblio">Fulcher, James. <cite>Capitalism: a Very
    Short Introduction</cite>. Oxford: Oxford University Press,
    2004.</p>

    <p>This book by James Fulcher is a description of capitalism
    and its origins. Useful information from this source include a
    definition of capitalism as well as a description of the causes
    of the end of feudalism, including the Black Death. I used
    information from this book in the sections on my website about
    previous systems as well as the section that describes
    capitalism.</p>

    <p class="biblio">Galbraith, John Kenneth. <cite>Economic
    Perspective: a Critical Essay.</cite> Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
    1987.</p>

    <p>John Kenneth Galbraith traces the evolution of economic
    ideas from Aristotle's time to that of Keynes. A useful fact
    from Galbraith's book included his list of the principle flaws
    of mercantilism: negative attitude toward competition, belief
    in state intervention of the economy, and belief that
    accumulation of pecuniary wealth in the form of gold and silver
    should be the primary goal of personal and state policy.
    Another piece of information from his book that I found useful
    was his statement that the start of the Industrial Revolution
    lead Smith to write about the principles of the beginning of
    labor in <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite>. I used information
    from this book in the sections on my website about previous
    systems as well as the section that describes capitalism.</p>

    well as the lives and times of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Henry
    George, John Manyard Kenyes, Thomas Malthus, and John Stuart
    Mill. Some useful information from this source was his
    description of a 1666 French law restricting the innovation of
    new methods of weaving cloth as an example of how government
    restrictions under mercantilism were detrimental to all, as
    well as his description of Adam Smith's <em lang="fr" xml:lang=
    "fr">laissez-faire</em> policy as "the least government is the
    best." I used information from this source in the sections on
    my website about previous systems as well as the section that
    describes capitalism.</p>

    <p class="biblio">Friedman, Milton. <cite>Capitalism and
    Freedom</cite>. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press,
    1962.</p>

    <p>In this book, Milton Friedman describes the role of
    capitalism in a free society. Useful information from this
    source include his argument that capitalism makes it harder to
    discriminate against people because of their race or their
    views, because it is economically disadvantageous to do so as
    an example of how <em lang="fr" xml:lang=
    "fr">laissez-faire</em> capitalism works to the benefit of
    society. I used information from this source in my website in
    the section about how <em lang="fr" xml:lang=

    <p class="biblio">Rae, John.  <cite>Life of Adam Smith</cite>.  London:
    Macmillan and Co, 1895.</p>
  
  <p>This source is an account of the life of Adam Smith, written
    more than a century after his death.  Useful information from this
    source was the quote about Adam Smith's kidnapping by gypsies,
    which I used in the short biography of Smith on my web site.</p>


    <p class="biblio">Rostow, Walt Whitman. <cite>How It All Began:

    <p>This book attempts to at explaining the origins of the
    modern economy and why industrial growth happened the way it
    did. It describes the transition from feudalism into
    mercantilism and from mercantilism into <em lang="fr" xml:lang=
    "fr">laissez-faire</em> capitalism. Useful information from
    this source include the description of European exploration as
    beginning the commercial revolution and the end of feudalism,
    and the description of the beginning of the Industrial
    Revolution as the end of mercantilism. I used information from
    this source in my website in the section about how <em lang=

    Adam Smith's views on <em lang="fr" xml:lang=
    "fr">laissez-faire</em> capitalism. Useful information from
    this source included his criticisms of Oxford University and
    how they lead to his views on public education, as well as
    information on Adam Smith's early life and its argument that
    the publication of the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> in 1776
    caused a "second revolution," comparable to Jefferson's. I used
    information from this source in my website in the biography
    section as well as in the section that describes

    September 2008
    &lt;http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Smith.html&gt;.</p>

    <p>This biography of Adam Smith provided information necessary
    for creating my product and provided a start for my research.
    It also provided insights into Adam Smith's theories and
    viewpoints. One useful fact from this source was the
    description of Smith's attitudes on mercantilism and how trade
    opens up new markets for surplus goods and provides commodities
    from abroad at a lower cost than from home. I used information
    from this source in my website in the biography of Adam Smith
    as well as in the section that describes capitalism.</p>

    <p>This web site by Brad Delong about Adam Smith describes his
    contributions to economics and quotes from his book <cite>The
    Wealth of Nations</cite> in order to describe his viewpoints.
    It also provides a brief biography of Adam Smith. Useful
    information from this source includes Adam Smith's dates of
    baptism and death, as well as his description of Adam Smith's
    work as "the most influential work on economics ever written."
    Delong's quotes from Adam Smith's work also helped me in
    figuring out how to further direct my research and in knowing
    what quotes might be useful to cite from <cite>Wealth of
    Nations</cite>. I used information from this source in my

    <p>This article describes the principles of mercantilism and
    how it differed from <em lang="fr" xml:lang=
    "fr">laissez-faire</em> capitalism. Useful information from
    this source included the description of mercantilism as
    considering the principal benefit of trade as the importation
    of gold, as well as its description of laws such as the
    Navigation Acts, which sought to restrict trade according to
    mercantilist principles. I used information from this site in

    <p>This article on capitalism by Richard Hooker provided
    background information on capitalism for my research, including
    a definition of capitalism and what its principles are. Useful
    information from this source included its description of
    capitalism as the division of labor and the idea that
    individuals pursuing their own interests will guarantee the
    interests of society as a whole. I used information from this

    &lt;http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Capitalism.html&gt;.</p>

    <p>This article describes capitalism as well as its origins.
    Useful information from this source includes the statement that
    the basic tenets of capitalism or "economic individualism" are
    that the pursuit of self-interest and the right to own private
    property are morally defensible as legally legitimate and that
    under capitalism the state protects individual rights to decide
    what to produce and what prices to sell things at. It was also
    useful to see its viewpoint that the Industrial Revolution,
    which marked the end of mercantilism and the start of
    capitalism, did not create poverty but merely made it more
    visible. Information from this site was used in the section
    that describes <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</em>

    <p>This article by Jonathan Mercantini describes the economic
    system of mercantilism and how it influenced European
    colonization. Smith rejected mercantilism in favor of <em lang=
    "fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</em> capitalism. This article
    provided information on mercantilism that I could use in order
    to show the differences between Smith's system and mercantilism
    and the improvements provided by capitalism. Some useful
    information from this source include its description of the
    enforcement of mercantilism through the Navigation Acts of 1651
    by giving Britain a monopoly on imports and exports and how
    under mercantilism, prices are set by the government in order
    to keep exports greater than imports. I used information from

    <p>This biography of Adam Smith provided information necessary
    for my product and provided a start for my research. Useful
    information from this source included years that Adam Smith
    taught at different universities as well as the statement that

    <p>This source is a video of Professor W. Miller. In this
    video, he explains the economic system that was current in
    Smith's time as well as its limitations. He shows how Smith's
    theory of the "invisible hand" makes capitalism improve living
    conditions for both consumers and business owners and how
    capitalism was an improvement on previous economic systems. For
    instance, Professor Miller describes how craft guilds dictated
    the number of apprentices that people could have, thus limiting
    people from expanding their business, and that Adam Smith's
    <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</em> "system of
    perfect liberty" aimed to fix this by allowing people to act in
    self-interest, with little government intervention. This video
    provided information that was used in the section on my website
