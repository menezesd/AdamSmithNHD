    <h3 id="whatitis">What is It?</h3>
    <p><em lang="fr">Laissez-faire</em> is French for "allow to
    do." <em lang="fr">Laissez-faire</em> capitalism, which Smith
    referred to as "the system of natural liberty," involved minimal
    government intervention in the economy.  Smith created it as an
    alternative to the then current theory
    of <a href="systems.html#mercantilism">mercantilism</a>, in which
    the state exerted a high degree of control over industry and
    trade:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>All systems either of preference or of restraint, therefore,
      being thus completely taken away, the obvious and simple system
      of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord.  Every
      man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left
      perfectly free to pursue his own interest in his own way and to
      bring both his industry and capital into competition with those
      of any other men, or order of men. (Smith 300)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="invisible">The Invisible Hand</h3>

    <p>Without government restrictions, business owners compete with
    each other for customers, necessitating improvement in the
    production of products or services.  Smith referred to this effect
    as the "invisible hand."</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>By directing that industry in such a manner that its produce
      may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and
      he is in this, as in many other cases, lead by an invisible hand
      to promote an end which was no part of his intention. (Smith
      194)</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>The actions of self interest, as directed by "the invisible
    hand" serve to augment charity, which cannot, by itself, provide
    one with the essentials of life:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or
      the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to
      their own self-interest. (Smith 7)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="division">The Division of Labor</h3>

    <p>The division of labor results from the necessity of greater
    efficiency due to competition.  Sepcialization increases
    productivity because of accumulationof greater skill at the
    particular subtask and because less time is lost passing from one
    subtask to another. Division of Labor was important in
    industrialization, as Smith foresaw in the <cite>Wealth of
    Nations.</cite> He used pinmaking as an example. Without the
    division of labor, a worker could not produce even one pin a
    day. However, the operation of pinmaking is divided into several
    subtasks which allow ten workers to produce 48,000 pins a day.</p>

	of the division of labor. (Photograph from Living
	Gloucester).</p>
    </div>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third
      cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for
      receiving, the head; to make the head requires two or three
      distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to
      whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put
      them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin
      is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct
      operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by
      distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes
      perform two or three of them. (Smith 3)</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>However, later in the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, Smith
    criticizes the division of labor, saying that it could lead to a
    "mental mutilation" in workers.</p>

    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>People are free to conduct in their business the way they
      want to.</li>

      <li>Businesses must compete for customers and thus improve.</li>
      
      <li>This mechanism, known as the "invisible hand," promotes the
      good of the community of the whole because of an overall
      increase in quality and efficiency.</li>

      <li>One mechanism in the increasing of efficiency is the
      division of labor.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="banks">Smith's Views on the Current Bank Crisis</h3>

    <p>Smith believed that many smaller banks could better serve the
    public than a few larger ones, since the failure of one bank could
    not bring down the entire economy:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>The late multiplication of banking companies in both parts of
      the United Kingdom, an event by which many people have been much
      alarmed, instead of diminishing, increases the security of the
      public.  It obliges all of them to be more circumspect in their
      conduct, and, by not extending their currency beyond its due
      proportion to their cash, to guard themselves against those
      malicious runs which the rivalship of so many competitors is
      always ready to bring upon them.  It restrains the circulation
      of each particular company within a narrower circle, and reduces
      their circulating notes to a smaller number.  By dividing the
      whole circulation into a greater number of parts, the failure of
      any one company, an accident which, in the course of things,
      must sometimes happen, becomes of less consequence to the
      public.  This free competition, too, obliges all bankers to be
      more liberal in their dealings with their customers, lest their
      rivals should carry them away. In general, if any branch of
      trade, or any division of labour, be advantageous to the public,
      the freer and more general the competition, it will always be
      the more so. (Smtih 142)</p>
